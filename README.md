## About My Research

My research intersects computer vision, deep learning, and the development of innovative adaptation techniques for **visual foundation models**. I work on:

- **Continuous Quantification in Microscopy**  
  Applying deep learning techniques to analyze microscopic images over time and at scale.

- **Adaptation Methods**  
  Exploring how large foundation models can be fine-tuned or adapted for specialized tasks in scientific imaging.

- **Foundations & Applications**  
  Contributing to the broader scientific community by publishing and sharing insights related to emerging AI frameworks, especially in the context of microscopy and medical imaging.

## Current Project

I currently work on the **DFG-funded project: Berlin Initiative for Applied Foundation Model Research (Appl-FM)**. This project aims to explore and apply foundation models to a variety of real-world use cases, emphasizing practical, high-impact applications in AI research and development.
