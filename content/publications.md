### ["On the Domain Robustness of Contrastive Vision-Language Models](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-032-02813-6_5)
Koddenbrock, M., Hoffmann, R., Brodmann, D. & Rodner, E. (2025). *KI 2025.*
> We present DeepBench, a framework for assessing the domain-specific robustness of vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike standard benchmarks, DeepBench uses an LLM to generate realistic, context-aware image corruptions tailored to target domains, without requiring labels. Evaluating multiple contrastive VLM architectures across six real-world domains, we find substantial variability in robustness, underscoring the need for domain-aware evaluation. [DeepBench is open-source](https://github.com/ml-lab-htw/deepbench).

### ["Oh LLM, I'm Asking Thee, Please Give Me a Decision Tree": Zero-Shot Decision Tree Induction and Embedding with Large Language Models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3711896.3736818)
Knauer, R., Koddenbrock, M., Wallsberger, R., Brisson, N., ... & Rodner, E. (2025). *ACM KDD 2025.*
> This paper demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can generate intrinsically interpretable decision trees without any training data, surpassing data-driven trees on some small-sized tabular datasets and performing on par with data-driven tree-based embeddings on average. [The code is open-source.](https://github.com/ml-lab-htw/llm-trees)

### [Robust Weight Imprinting: Insights from Neural Collapse and Proxy-Based Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14572)
Westerhoff, J., Atefi, G., Koddenbrock, M., Figueroa, A., Löser, A., Rodner, E., Gers, F. *Under Review at TMLR.*
> This latest work proposes a framework for imprinting, identifying three main components: generation, normalization, and aggregation, and show an increase of up to 4% in challenging scenarios with complex data distributions for new classes. Furthermore, we found connections of neural collapse to multi-proxy imprinting. [The code is open-source.](https://github.com/DATEXIS/IMPRINT)

### [Feedback-driven object detection and iterative model improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19835)
Tenckhoff, S., Koddenbrock, M., & Rodner, E. (2024). *Proceedings of the Berlin Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Applications (AI4EA).*
> This publication presents the development and evaluation of a platform designed to interactively improve object detection models, demonstrating significant time reduction and efficiency gains in annotation without compromising quality. [The framework is open-source.](https://github.com/ml-lab-htw/iterative-annotate)

### [Between Measurement and Simulation. An Application Example of How to Create a Modal Digital Twin Using FE Model Updating](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77348-9_6)
Koddenbrock, M., Heimann, J., Herfert, D., Pehe, J., & Wargulski, L. (2021). *In Model Validation and Uncertainty Quantification, Volume 3: Proceedings of the 39th IMAC.*
> This paper determines the modal parameters of a machine frame using experimental modal analysis and updates the model to match simulated parameters. The results show the updated model accurately represents the real system.

### [Efficiency and Accuracy of a Divergence-Free Discretization for the Steady Incompressible Navier–Stokes Equations (German)](/pdf/Masterarbeit.pdf)
Master Thesis (2014). *Not published.*
> This thesis addresses the challenges in numerically implementing the Navier–Stokes and Stokes equations, focusing on the issue of incorrect force balancing... Key results on the existence theory of solutions, suitable examples, and the efficiency of Picard and Newton iterations are discussed.
---
### [Representation of Integers by Binary Quadratic Forms (German)](/pdf/Bachelorarbeit.pdf)
Bachelor Thesis (2011). *Not published.*
> This thesis explores representing integers through binary quadratic forms. It covers algebraic tools to determine for which integers x and y the number n can be represented by ax^2 + bxy + cy^2...
