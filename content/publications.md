### [Feedback-driven object detection and iterative model improvement](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=de&user=wqHic0AAAAAJ&citation_for_view=wqHic0AAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C)
**Tenckhoff, S., Koddenbrock, M., & Rodner, E.** (2024). <br>
*Proceedings of the Berlin Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Applications (AI4EA).*
> This publication presents the development and evaluation of a platform designed to interactively improve object detection models, demonstrating significant time reduction and efficiency gains in annotation without compromising quality.

### ["Oh LLM, I'm Asking Thee, Please Give Me a Decision Tree": Zero-Shot Decision Tree Induction and Embedding with Large Language Models](https://doi.org/10.1145/3711896.3736818)
**Knauer, R., Koddenbrock, M., Wallsberger, R., Brisson, N. M., Duda, G. N., Falla, D., ... & Rodner, E.** (2025). <br>
*ACM KDD 2025.*
> This paper demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can generate intrinsically interpretable decision trees without any training data, surpassing data-driven trees on some small-sized tabular datasets and performing on par with data-driven tree-based embeddings on average.

### [Robust Weight Imprinting: Insights from Neural Collapse and Proxy-Based Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14572)
**Westerhoff, J., Atefi, G., Koddenbrock, M., Figueroa, A., Löser, A., Rodner, E., Gers, F.** <br>
*Under Review at ECML-PKDD 2025.*
> This latest work proposes a framework for imprinting, identifying three main components: generation, normalization, and aggregation, and show an increase of up to 4% in challenging scenarios with complex data distributions for new classes. Furthermore, we found connections of neural collapse to multi-proxy imprinting.

## Earlier Work

### [Condition monitoring of a mechanical pulsatile heart support system via support-vector machine](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-26236-4_6)
**Koddenbrock, M., & Heinze, H.** (2022). <br>
*In International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods 2022.*
> This paper presents a method to detect increased risk of complications during the use of a VAD using acoustic measurements. The main challenge is ensuring consistent monitoring despite various factors affecting ultrasonic measurements.

### [Between Measurement and Simulation. An Application Example of How to Create a Modal Digital Twin Using FE Model Updating](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77348-9_6)
**Koddenbrock, M., Heimann, J., Herfert, D., Pehe, J., & Wargulski, L.** (2021). <br>
*In Model Validation and Uncertainty Quantification, Volume 3: Proceedings of the 39th IMAC.*
> This paper determines the modal parameters of a machine frame using experimental modal analysis and updates the model to match simulated parameters. The results show the updated model accurately represents the real system.

### [An innovative 3D color barcode: Intuitive and realistic visualization of digital data.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2983468.2983486)
**Koddenbrock, M., Herfert, D., Püschel, F., Rataj, C., & Melitzki, M.** (2016). <br>
*In Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Computer Systems and Technologies.*
> The increasing popularity of mobile devices has led to a rise in barcode technologies. This publication presents a new approach for color barcodes that integrates design and security for intuitive visualization of digital data.

### [Efficiency and Accuracy of a Divergence-Free Discretization for the Steady Incompressible Navier–Stokes Equations (German)](/pdf/Masterarbeit.pdf)
**Master Thesis (2014)** <br>
*not published*
> This thesis addresses the challenges in numerically implementing the Navier–Stokes and Stokes equations, focusing on the issue of incorrect force balancing... Key results on the existence theory of solutions, suitable examples, and the efficiency of Picard and Newton iterations are discussed.

### [Representation of Integers by Binary Quadratic Forms (German)](/pdf/Bachelorarbeit.pdf)
**Bachelor Thesis (2011)** <br>
*not published*
> This thesis explores representing integers through binary quadratic forms. It covers algebraic tools to determine for which integers x and y the number n can be represented by ax^2 + bxy + cy^2...
