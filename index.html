    <title>Adapting Visual Foundation Models</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>I am a <strong>PhD student</strong> focusing on computer vision and machine learning. My thesis is titled:</p>

    <h2><em>Adaptation Techniques for Visual Foundation Models for Continuous Quantification in Microscopy</em></h2>

    <p>I am part of the <strong>DFG project</strong>: <a href="https://www.bht-berlin.de/3873/article/9084">Berlin Initiative for Applied Foundation Model Research (Appl-FM)</a>.</p>

    <h2>About My Research</h2>

    <p>My research intersects computer vision, deep learning, and the development of innovative adaptation techniques for <strong>visual foundation models</strong>. I work on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Continuous Quantification in Microscopy</strong><br>Applying deep learning techniques to analyze microscopic images over time and at scale.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptation Methods</strong><br>Exploring how large foundation models can be fine-tuned or adapted for specialized tasks in scientific imaging.</li>
        <li><strong>Foundations & Applications</strong><br>Contributing to the broader scientific community by publishing and sharing insights related to emerging AI frameworks, especially in the context of microscopy and medical imaging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Project</h2>

    <p>I currently work on the <strong>DFG-funded project: Berlin Initiative for Applied Foundation Model Research (Appl-FM)</strong>. This project aims to explore and apply foundation models to a variety of real-world use cases, emphasizing practical, high-impact applications in AI research and development.</p>
