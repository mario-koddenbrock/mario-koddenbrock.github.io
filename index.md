I am a **PhD student** focusing on computer vision and machine learning. My thesis is titled:

**_Adaptation Techniques for Visual Foundation Models for Continuous Quantification in Microscopy_**

I am part of the **DFG project**: [_Berlin Initiative for Applied Foundation Model Research (Appl-FM)_.](https://www.bht-berlin.de/3873/article/9084)

## About My Research

My research intersects computer vision, deep learning, and the development of innovative adaptation techniques for **visual foundation models**. 

### Current Publications

#### [Feedback-driven object detection and iterative model improvement](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=de&user=wqHic0AAAAAJ&citation_for_view=wqHic0AAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C)
This publication presents the development and evaluation of a platform designed to interactively improve object detection models, demonstrating significant time reduction and efficiency gains in annotation without compromising quality.

#### ["Oh LLM, I'm Asking Thee, Please Give Me a Decision Tree": Zero-Shot Decision Tree Induction and Embedding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18594) (Under Review)
This paper demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can generate intrinsically interpretable decision trees without any training data, surpassing data-driven trees on some small-sized tabular datasets and performing on par with data-driven tree-based embeddings on average.

#### Robust Weight Imprinting: Insights from Neural Collapse and Proxy-Based Aggregation (Under Review)
This latest work proposes a framework for imprinting, identifying three main components: generation, normalization, and aggregation, and show an increase of up to 4\% in challenging scenarios with complex data distributions for new classes. Furthermore, we found connections of neural collapse to multi-proxy imprinting.


### Earlier Work

#### [Condition monitoring of a mechanical pulsatile heart support system via support-vector machine](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-26236-4_6)
This paper presents a method to detect increased risk of complications during the use of a VAD using acoustic measurements. The main challenge is ensuring consistent monitoring despite various factors affecting ultrasonic measurements.


#### [Efficiency and Accuracy of a Divergence-Free Discretization for the Steady Incompressible Navier–Stokes Equations](./res/Masterarbeit.pdf)
This master thesis addresses the challenges in numerically implementing the Navier–Stokes and Stokes equations, focusing on the issue of incorrect force balancing due to a lack of orthogonality between irrotational and discretely divergence-free functions. Key results on the existence theory of solutions, suitable examples, and the efficiency of Picard and Newton iterations are discussed.

#### [Representation of Integers by Binary Quadratic Forms](./res/Bachelorarbeit.pdf)
This bachelor thesis explores representing integers through binary quadratic forms, starting with an introduction and elementary proofs. It then covers algebraic tools to determine for which integers `x` and `y` the number `n` can be represented by `ax^2 + bxy + cy^2`. Additionally, it briefly overviews continued fractions theory, useful for finding `x` and `y`. The main results show the problem is equivalent to finding certain elements of a quadratic field whose norm is `n/a`.
