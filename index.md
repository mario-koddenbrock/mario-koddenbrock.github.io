## About My Research

My research intersects computer vision, deep learning, and the development of innovative adaptation techniques for **visual foundation models**. 

### Current Publications

#### [Feedback-driven object detection and iterative model improvement](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=de&user=wqHic0AAAAAJ&citation_for_view=wqHic0AAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C)

###### _Tenckhoff, S., Koddenbrock, M., & Rodner, E. (2024). Proceedings of the Berlin Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Applications (AI4EA 2024)._

This publication presents the development and evaluation of a platform designed to interactively improve object detection models, demonstrating significant time reduction and efficiency gains in annotation without compromising quality.

#### ["Oh LLM, I'm Asking Thee, Please Give Me a Decision Tree": Zero-Shot Decision Tree Induction and Embedding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18594) 

###### Knauer, R., Koddenbrock, M., Wallsberger, R., Brisson, N. M., Duda, G. N., Falla, D., ... & Rodner, E. (2025). Under Review at KDD.

This paper demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can generate intrinsically interpretable decision trees without any training data, surpassing data-driven trees on some small-sized tabular datasets and performing on par with data-driven tree-based embeddings on average.

#### Robust Weight Imprinting: Insights from Neural Collapse and Proxy-Based Aggregation

###### Westerhoff, J., Atefi, G., Koddenbrock, M., Figueroa, A., Löser, A., Rodner, E., Gers, F. (2025). Under Review at ECML-PKDD.

This latest work proposes a framework for imprinting, identifying three main components: generation, normalization, and aggregation, and show an increase of up to 4\% in challenging scenarios with complex data distributions for new classes. Furthermore, we found connections of neural collapse to multi-proxy imprinting.

### Earlier Work

#### [Condition monitoring of a mechanical pulsatile heart support system via support-vector machine](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-26236-4_6)

###### Koddenbrock, M., & Heinze, H. (2022). In International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods (pp. 59-70). Cham: Springer International Publishing.

This paper presents a method to detect increased risk of complications during the use of a VAD using acoustic measurements. The main challenge is ensuring consistent monitoring despite various factors affecting ultrasonic measurements.

#### [Between Measurement and Simulation. An Application Example of How to Create a Modal Digital Twin Using FE Model Updating](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77348-9_6)

###### Koddenbrock, M., Heimann, J., Herfert, D., Pehe, J., & Wargulski, L. (2022). In Model Validation and Uncertainty Quantification, Volume 3: Proceedings of the 39th IMAC, A Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics 2021 (pp. 39-48). Springer International Publishing.
This paper determines the modal parameters of a machine frame using experimental modal analysis and updates the model to match simulated parameters. The results show the updated model accurately represents the real system.

#### [An innovative 3D color barcode: Intuitive and realistic visualization of digital data.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2983468.2983486)

###### Koddenbrock, M., Herfert, D., Püschel, F., Rataj, C., & Melitzki, M. (2016). In Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Computer Systems and Technologies 2016 (pp. 175-181).
The increasing popularity of mobile devices has led to a rise in barcode technologies, with a new approach presented for color barcodes that integrates design and security for intuitive visualization of digital data.

#### [Efficiency and Accuracy of a Divergence-Free Discretization for the Steady Incompressible Navier–Stokes Equations (German)](./res/Masterarbeit.pdf)

###### Master thesis - not published 

This thesis addresses the challenges in numerically implementing the Navier–Stokes and Stokes equations, focusing on the issue of incorrect force balancing due to a lack of orthogonality between irrotational and discretely divergence-free functions. Key results on the existence theory of solutions, suitable examples, and the efficiency of Picard and Newton iterations are discussed.

#### [Representation of Integers by Binary Quadratic Forms (German)](./res/Bachelorarbeit.pdf)

###### Bachelor thesis - not published 

This thesis explores representing integers through binary quadratic forms, starting with an introduction and elementary proofs. It then covers algebraic tools to determine for which integers `x` and `y` the number `n` can be represented by `ax^2 + bxy + cy^2`. Additionally, it briefly overviews continued fractions theory, useful for finding `x` and `y`. The main results show the problem is equivalent to finding certain elements of a quadratic field whose norm is `n/a`.
